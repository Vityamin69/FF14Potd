#### Caution
#### Sight
These have cleaves/double autos. Be careful when solo.

##### Wolf

##### Scary
#### Sight
Has a cleave that applies Frostbite, a powerful DOT. Get Esuna/Erase ready to remove this from whoever gets hit by it.

Don’t touch them on casters. Ranged DPS can take them on without any items.

#### Wisent (Patrol)

#### Caution
#### Sight
While these are easy to kill, they have a DPS check where if not killed in time (3o seconds), they will suck everyone in, apply a HUGE heavy debuff (like 95-99% slow), and do a stomp that will deal around 90% of a DPS’s health and apply Paralysis. Be careful if you pull multiple at the same time.

The suction can be avoided with Surecast/Arms Length, and the enrage cast be interrupted or slept.

#### Snowclops (Patrol)

#### Caution
#### Sight
Has 2 one-shot skills with no telegraph - Glower and 100-tonze swing. Glower is a frontal line AOE which is cast almost immediately after being pulled, and 100-tonze swing is a point-blank AOE (so, walk away from it). These can be stunned.

#### Sasquatch

#### Caution
#### Proximity
These aggro by proximity, and have two skills that they cast when not in combat - Ripe Banana and Chest Thump. Ripe Banana will give it a huge physical damage buff, and then it will proceed to cast Chest Thump many times, dealing AOE damage to anybody within a one room radius while applying stacks of physical vulnerability. As such, do not fight mobs near rooms with Sasquatches in them. NEVER pull a Sasquatch that is buffed, or else you will be one shot - always wait for the buff to wear out.

Highly recommended to use Steel if solo, as a Browbeat crit will do 13K, 1 shotting you if paired with an autoattack.

#### Bird of the deep palace
#### Caution
#### Proximity
These do a reasonable amount of damage with their cleaves, but you need to watch out for their Revelation ability which is an AOE that applies confusion.

After fighting these for a little while, they will cast Tropical Wind, granting them a huge haste and damage buff. During this time, they will spam Revelation exclusively (you may still get autoattacked in melee range), where each one is pretty much a guaranteed one shot. You can stun the buff or remove the haste with a slow effect.

###### Impossible
#### Sight

Has a cleave that applies a DOT, and spams Flying Frenzy, which targets a random party member, dealing huge damage, stun, and applying vulnerability in an AOE around that member. Spread out. Don’t even try to fight this solo.

MCH can burst these with cooldowns, Strength & Steel, however. Because MCH.

#### Dhamel - Proximity

Most of these mobs are not threatening aside from their autoattack damage.
