## Solo
### Tl;dr - kite and kill zombie adds (don’t let them touch you), succubus add is optional (dotting it is worth it though)
Aside from avoiding telegraphs, there are a few things to look out for on this boss. After the second “Darkness, to me” call, she will summon 4 Fanatic Zombies in each corner of the room, each aggroing on one person. These will slowly crawl up to you, and grab on to you if they get close enough. If you get grabbed, you will be rooted until that zombie is dead, which might get you caught in some lethal AOEs. These zombies are weak to air magic, and can be one shot with a single Veraero from a red mage. This boss will also summon a Fanatic Succubus at some point, which does a fair amount of damage with its cleave and autoattack. It has 60K health, and I like to ignore it (you usually have vuln stacks on the boss, so it’s better to just hit that). If you don’t kill it, the boss will “eat” it, restoring health equal to the HP of the add. Shortly afterwards, the boss will cast a global AOE Blood Rain, which deals 13K damage without Steel. Heal through it as necessary, and then the attack pattern starts all over.
