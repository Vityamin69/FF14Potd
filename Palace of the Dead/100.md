## Solo

Use strength, steel, and then Sustaining Potion and lust. Spam Void Fire II for the entire duration - donâ€™t worry, it will melt the adds as they spawn/respawn.

As soon as the transformation wears off, use another Sustaining Potion and use Resolution. Then you can spam Heavenly Judge for a decent amount of damage for the entire duration, while removing all those corpses from the ground.
