## Solo

### Tl;dr - stand on side, fire, ice, fire, ice, then run to center.

Similar to the F30 boss, except this time it casts Fear Itself way faster. Run to the center immediately after the second ice ball, and make sure nobody is standing in the center prior to that, so you donâ€™t get goop there.
