## Mobs
#### Wamouracampa/ archeosaur
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-f3NXdt57ddQzpDgtOnKVMR33ei326mPEx7wq7kLDrs6IsYJfTVHKmfqdZ7v3fhT79xJVGPs06l1WkPAM-q_-Ov-uJF2Qxgo3jsOkG4lPdNWHI7_SEzBjCG4-zf7ezCpuw)
#### Caution
#### Wamouracampa - Sound
#### Archeosaur - Sight

Has a cleave or double autoattack. Can kill a non-tank with crits, even with on-point healing + sustain potion. Be very cautious and consider using Steel. Wamouracampas aggro by sound and are blind, so you can walk to avoid them. When kited, aren’t that bad, but I would try not to pull an archeosaur unless you have to.

##### Claw

##### Scary
#### Sight

Will suck in a random member and stab them for a decent amount of damage. Also has a targeted AOE Tail Screw that deals damage and applies slow. It is killable solo by a healer/RDM if you use Steel.

Knockback immunity does not work on the suction.

##### Worm

##### Scary
#### Sound

Randomly hits people within half a room with an instant AOE that deals a fair amount of damage. Has a double-auto, and a DPS check (around 30 seconds) where it will suck everyone in and shortly afterwards, deal 20K damage to people in range. It is possible to tank this and then heal through it as a healer/RDM with Steel, but with crits, you will be dead. You can also stagger the mob and kite it to outrange the suction at 30 second (very large AOE). Knockback immunity does not work. After getting sucked in, you can quickly use a displacement skill to back away from the worm before the big damage AOE.

These aggro by sound, so you can toggle walk to avoid them.

###### Crawler

###### Impossible
#### Sound

These have an instant conal AOE burst attack that deals 7K damage (on top of their 5K autoattack) and applies a strong slow effect. Additionally, they have an instant conal AOE poison attack that ticks for 3K damage a tick. Spread out when you fight these, and get that Esuna ready.

These aggro by sound, so you can toggle walk to avoid them.

###### Flood Dragon

###### Impossible
#### Sight

These have an instant circular AOE burst attack that inflicts a very potent DoT, similar to crawlers. Get Esuna/Erase ready, and spread out so multiple people don’t get hit.

Solo: Don’t pull this.

##### Garm (Patrol)
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CKmv1F_IAslLs3TNFh95Rn61cXmH_fKQXh_GIOoJvZJieniWsZgzlAjyLra4DiBlNcxdRo381Gwh00dEZptJMYESyTFJREhxO7KhShxQxGU_cAO20z6DXJ96nkWkj_9wUg)
##### Scary
#### Proximity

Aggros by proximity, and has an arsenal of one-shot abilities. The two main skills are “The Ram’s Voice” and “The Dragon’s Voice”. Ram is a point-blank AOE, and Dragon is a ~3/4 room sized AOE with a safe spot in the middle. So, when you see Ram being channeled, run away, and then if you see Dragon, run inside. These can be silenced. Note that in my experience, people get hit by Ram 10x more often than Dragon, as Ram casts faster.

If you are proficient with dodging these mechanics, these are actually the easiest mobs to kill when solo from 187-189. But, DO NOTE that they can autoattack crit for 10K damage!

### All other mobs
### Easy
#### Sight (yes, even Sprites are sight)

Most of these mobs are not threatening aside from their autoattack damage.

Don’t pull Sprites on ranged DPS/no sustain casters.
