## Solo
While mechanically similar to the F60 boss, this one can hit like a truck. While you can solo it without steel (on RDM at least), I really, really would recommend using steel for this boss and beyond.

The bleed puddles created by the Hail of Sorrow instant AOE hurt like crazy, dealing over 5K damage if you eat a tick. Other than that, make sure you donâ€™t get knocked into an exploding ball on the edge or you will be nearly one shot.
