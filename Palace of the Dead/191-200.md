## Mobs
### Mummy/Trap/ Dragon

### Easy
#### Proximity
#### Trap - Sound
Easiest mobs to pick on on the lower floors.

Note that, unlike any other dragon, the ones on this set aggro by movement. Their Evil Eye (red eye mechanic) is a one shot, so make sure to look away.

#### Hippogryph/Corse/Gourmand

#### Caution
#### Hippogryph - Sight
#### Others - Proximity

These hit really hard with their cleave/double autoattacks. Don’t try to fight them solo without Steel.

#### Fachan (Patrol)

#### Caution
#### Sight
Similar to Ahrimans from 130s, these have a no-telegraph conal AOE, except instead of Level 5 Petrify, they cast Level 5 Death. From the name, it’s pretty obvious what happens if you get hit.

##### Knight

##### Scary
#### Proximity

These do crazy damage - you want to avoid them when solo if possible. They will also cast a doughnut-shaped AOE Death Spiral, dealing around 20K damage to anybody not standing next to it. NEVER PULL THESE WHEN A WRAITH IS NEARBY.

They do have an “enrage” cast that doubles their damage output for a short amount of time, while giving them a defense buff. This means their buster will hit for 9.5k with steel, non-crit.

#### Wraith

#### Caution
#### Proximity

These will cast an AOE from across rooms at you, which will one shot anybody hit (for the most part). NEVER pull a knight when one of these is around, because their AOE Accursed Pox will fill in the Death Spiral doughnut, leaving you with nowhere to run.

##### Scary
#### Sound

Nothing too special about these aside from the fact that they are the highest DPS monsters in here. Spread out to avoid taking unnecessary AOE damage, or avoid them entirely by walking when they are nearby.
