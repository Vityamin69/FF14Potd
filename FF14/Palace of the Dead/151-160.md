## Mobs

#### Pot, Deadeye, Pudding, Marolith (Patrol)
#### Caution
#### All but deadeye - Proximity
#### Deadeye - Sight
Has a cleave/double autoattack. Be careful with their burst damage, and use sustain potions if necessary.

---
#### Imp
#### Caution
#### Sight
Casts Void Blizzard, which inflicts a long slow, as well as Ice Spikes, which causes any autoattacks or weaponskills to deal high damage back to you. Recommended to cancel Void Blizzard and then click off the mob for the duration of Ice Spikes to prevent auto attacks if applicable.

---
#### Mindflayer
#### Caution
#### Sight
Double auto that heals them for the amount of damage they deal. Very annoying to fight.

---
### All other mobs
### Easy
#### Arch Demon (Patrol) - Proximity
#### Others - Sight

Most of these mobs are not threatening aside from their autoattack damage.
