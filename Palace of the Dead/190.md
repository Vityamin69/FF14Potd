## Solo
This boss is similar mechanically to the 90 boss, except with colors flipped around. This means that you kill the BLUE bomb when it spawns (Remedy Bomb) and you push the RED bomb into the boss (Lava Bomb). Note that if you get hit by a blue bomb explosion or Sap, you will be inflicted with Deep Freeze and will most likely die if you do not have Steel.

This boss’s cleave Scalding Scoulding can hit extremely hard (12K with no steel), so if you are tanking on a non-tank class or soloing, you need to have very good timing on your heals to keep yourself peaked up for the incoming cleaves.
DO NOT OPEN WITH LUST. The boss will cleave right away and you may die before you get the stacks off. There is a window in the boss’s rotation where he will cast 3 Saps in a row (during Remedy Bomb cycle) - this is a good time to lust. See the solo video for reference. Another option (that requires a bit of planning) is to take advantage of the static spawns to position the boss on top of where the Remedy Bomb spawns, and use Lust to kill the bomb while getting stacks on the boss. The boss will be casting Saps during this time, so you should be able to survive.

Boss rotation is as follows:
- Cleave
- Remedy Bomb spawn (1, 3, 5 spawns for Lust: Top, Middle, Bottom Right)
- Sap (3x)
- Cleave
- Sap
- Lava Bomb spawn (Right, Middle, Top Right, Left, Middle, Upper Middle)

[Repeat]
