## Solo
This boss is similar to the F70 boss, except the water puddle from Douse will buff it with haste and physical damage up. The tank should pull this boss slowly in a circle around the map, making sure to move it out of every Douse puddle it creates.
Save sprint/backstep abilities for the first Heavy effect applied with diminishing returns, as you will need it to avoid the upcoming Electrogenesis AOE. (sprint when the Heavy has around 7 seconds left).
