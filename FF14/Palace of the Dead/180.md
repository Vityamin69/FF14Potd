## Solo

This boss is similar to that of F80, with a few key differences. First, it will cast Charybdis twice in a row now, so tornados will be everywhere. Trounce will not be a one-shot but will deal around 13K damage without Steel (it CAN crit! Watch out!). However, Lightningbolt (frontal conal telegraph) will one shot a DPS without Steel, but… what is a DPS without Steel doing standing in front of the boss?![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eJpt5aktPsPt3Li5HT38Be-Zkz1mNr5XhwerPtlow2chM_zfmBQ4a1DJvoIxkRRr-EaRJgeCackFEt6jeLt_WBRuFDw6dUwvALHNbqDKuPpHbG-jSI2Q_S7bK2LiikuoTxixOQlo)

Note that Trounce is ALWAYS cast from the top or bottom of the map, alternating between the two.

The hardest part of this boss is when it drops under 15%. It will spam Ecliptic Meteor over and over again, and the cast time is much faster than that of F80 - meteors will strike down 80% of everybody’s maximum health every 9 seconds. As such, it is smart to use Lust around 50% to make sure the Lust debuff will be up for the burn phase (wait until ~20% for solo). Save your LB2 for this (TANKS, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT TANK LB BECAUSE IT DOESN’T DO ANYTHING).

If you have no faith in your party’s DPS, RDM/Healers get ready for an intense solo! Simply use a sustain potion and heal yourself twice between meteors, while squeezing in as much DPS as possible.

Never stand in melee range in FRONT of the boss while it spams meteors, as it is allowed to autoattack you between meteors if you do so, thus one-shotting you!

Lust at ~20-21%, and then slow push into 15%. After the boss is 15%, use autoattacks or a couple weak abilities to push it from like 15.9% to as close to 15.0% as possible (you can’t actually see this number, so you need to play it a bit safe). Wait for the boss to use a skill (commonly wait for the double Charybdis cast after Trounce), then use your burst rotation. Healers and RDM have this easy, but other classes need to have their heals (Second Wind, Super Potion, Bloodbath, etc) ready and the burst rotation on-point.
